Added NuGet support however, I haven't included web.config entries yet.  See the demo project if they are needed.
Still trying to figure out a reliable way to alter configs without destroying someone's current WCF settings.

TODO:

Finish demo web app pages for different rendering methods ie: pure js, controls packaged in .dlls...etc
Clean up demo project, possibly rename it
Add more documentation to GitHub
Put up running demo on devlpr.net
