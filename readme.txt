Added NuGet web.config transforms, only issue is if <System.ServiceModel> element doesn't exist NuGet doesn't create the element.
Looking into this issue now.

TODO:

Finish demo web app pages for different rendering methods ie: pure js, controls packaged in .dlls...etc
along with WebMethods and .ascx
Clean up demo project, possibly rename it
Add more documentation to GitHub
